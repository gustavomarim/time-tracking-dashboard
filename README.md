## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project I was able to implement all the techniques and concepts learned along my trajectory of studies with programming, through college and complementary courses focused on web development.

I could understand the use of HTML semantic markup in a clean way, the organized styling with CSS FlexBox and Grid Layout, and finally, the manipulation of the DOM with JavaScript, using events and consuming an API.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus and deepen my studies in the JavaScript programming language, seeking fluency in the technology in order to facilitate problem solving and improve writing clean code.

### How to run the project?
